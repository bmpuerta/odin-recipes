        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The famous anabolic icecream from the Youtube fitness community is now at your
            fingertips with this easy-to-use recipe. Made famous by Greg Doucette and perfected
            by many Youtubers such as E4CM, Will Tennyson, Remington James, and the Iron Musket,
            this recipe puts the Ninja Blender's impressive abilities to the test. The outcome 
            is a thick, decadent, and macro-friendly dessert with a fraction of the calories 
            in typical store-bought, run-of-the-mill shakes and ice creams.</p>
