        <p>Who knew vegetables could taste so good? This macro-friendly recipe takes the humble
            cauliflower to new heights by combining its starchy texture with umami-rich ingredients
            and salt to create a smooth and savory concoction that tastes just like traditional
            mashed potatoes without the pesky carbs. You'll be wishing you had bought more cauliflower
            from the grocery store. Let the cut begin!
